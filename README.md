# SpawnApples
Minecraft plugin that spawns apples at a predetermined spot for a server

This plugin is specifically coded for the use of Vibecraft.mc
While anyone is welcome to the code, it will require modification of the spawn points for it to work.

This plugin will spawn one of three apple choices, regular, golden, or enchanted, every thirty to fourty five minutes.
Each apple has a different rarity.
apple - Common, 74%
golden apple - Rare, 20%
enchanted apple - Legendary, 6%

These items are intended as a type of currency for special features and custom enchantments.

Commands:
/apples enable - allow apples to start spawning
/apples disable - stop apples from spawning
/apples give - give the sender one apple of each rarity
/apples reload - reinitializes the plugin incase of emergency or misbehavior
/apples timer - gives time until next apple spawning
/apples sample - run a sample size of 100 apples to see estimated outcome. Useful for testing spawn percentages
/apples help - Displays commands in game
